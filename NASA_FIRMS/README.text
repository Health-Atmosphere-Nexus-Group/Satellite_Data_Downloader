NASA FIRMS Data Download
This script is designed for downloading NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System) data.

Data Sources and Sensors
NASA FIRMS provides data from three major sensors:

MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)
Resolution: 1 km
MODIS offers coarse-resolution global fire detection data.

VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite)
Resolution: 375 m
VIIRS provides higher-resolution fire detection data compared to MODIS.

Landsat (Landsat 7, 8, 9)
Resolution: 30 m
Depending on different spectral bands, the resolution may vary. For simplicity, it is generally considered 30 m.
Landsat offers the highest resolution among the three sensors.

Data Format
All downloaded data will be saved in TXT format.
The data includes historical records for each respective sensor.
